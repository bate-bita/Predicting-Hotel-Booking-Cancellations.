**Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations**

This project applies machine learning to predict hotel booking cancellations, offering actionable insights into customer behaviours and trends in the hospitality industry. Using data from Portuguese Resort and City Hotels, the project leverages **31 features** across **119,000 observations** to build robust predictive models.

### Project Overview
The dataset covers hotel bookings from **July 2015 to August 2017**, including both completed and cancelled bookings. It underwent thorough preprocessing to ensure quality analysis and effective modelling.

### Key Methodologies
- **Data Preparation:** Handled missing values, cleaned, and standardised datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysed booking trends, seasonality, and cancellation factors with visualisations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created and refined features to boost model accuracy.
- **Model Development:** Implemented multiple classification algorithms using Scikit-learn, focusing on predictive accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Enhanced model performance through parameter optimisation.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessed models with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
1. **Data Wrangling:** Extracted and transformed raw data into usable formats.
2. **Machine Learning Expertise:** Designed and tuned predictive models.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Improved model performance with meaningful features.
4. **Visualisation Proficiency:** Created intuitive plots to communicate insights.
5. **Performance Analysis:** Evaluated models using statistical and predictive metrics.

### Outcomes
The project highlights how machine learning can be applied in real-world scenarios to minimise cancellations and optimise booking strategies. It reflects strong capabilities in data preprocessing, algorithm development, and business-oriented analytics, making it a valuable resource for organisations in the hospitality sector.
